# Ergonomy in Technical Subjects

- [Ergonomic Statistics](https://github.com/clokman/academic-visualization/blob/master/Ergonomic%20Statistics.md)

## Split screens

This approach allows putting the old, linear, and text-based language on one side of the screen, while putting on the right side the modern, interactive, and visual representations of what is going on the left side.   

Examples:
- [Statistics](http://clokman.com/hosting/StatsVis/standard_deviation.swf) - An animation that is part of the "StatsVis Project" - This is a very early draft and needs corrections. The final version will be a remake in split-screen style.
- [Programming](https://vimeo.com/36579366) - Examples of interactive programming are in first ~20 minutes of the video.
- Dual articles -- Work in progress
